## About Us 

This pandemic has literally brought everyone on their knees, the despair and despondency that shrouded the country during covid gave us the motive to calibrate technology and help people out of these unprecedented times. Team Swasthify tries to provide its users with a service-based distinction of our partner hospitals from all across the country. What really keeps us going is a belief that one day we will make the notion of "hospitals at your fingertips" true.

## Problem Statement
Swasthify aims at mitigating the hardships people faced during this pandemic. We provide an interactive user interface where a user can directly interact with respective hospitals that are self-registered on our application. Users will get to access a spate of services that these hospitals provide. Hospitals can easily update the availability of these services by logging in to their dashboard. The services range from ICU beds availability to the number of vaccines that the hospitals have. Users can easily browse for these services in different cities and hospitals and then book them from the hospital of their choice. This application will also provide its users a prescription section where all the previous prescriptions of the users will be available for future reference.


## Features

#### Hospitals
-   Hospital Registration
-   Hospital Login
-   Data Entry

## How is our solution different

-   Our solution is different in an umpteen number of ways. It's a user-to-hospital interaction without any third-party involvement.
-   The ordeal which was at display during the second wave, due to data inadequacy manifested the need for an application where a user can access the real-time data updated by hospitals related to all emergency services, vaccines, etc.
-   Our application works in a similar way where a hospital gets to update the aforementioned services on its dashboard.
-   When a user logs in he gets to see the real-time changes made by hospitals, and thus he gets an articulated and pragmatic display of all the services offered by different hospitals all across the country.
-   Booking services using our application will also be an advantage as that would save users from unnecessary wobbling between hospitals.

## Future Possible Enhancements
-   Providing users the option to book a variety of services that the hospitals offer.
-   A prescription catalogue, from where a user can keep track of all his past prescriptions.
-   A doctor's clinic where a user can consult any registered doctor from across the country.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
